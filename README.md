# ACA_CRC
Design a digital circuit, called the encoder, which computes the check string, CRC-8 based,associated with a 16 bit data word. Design also a digital circuit,called the checker, which asserts the correction of the 24 bit CRC-8 coded word.

The assignment entails that some investigation should be made on finding the best possible algorithms for the implementation of the operations.
